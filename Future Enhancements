# BioPDBKit: Enhancements

## 1. Updating Dataset with Trained Information and Similarity Matrix

### Automated Data Augmentation
- **Description**: Implement a machine learning model to analyze existing data and identify new relationships or patterns. New relations are automatically added to the dataset.

### Similarity Matrix Integration
- **Description**: Develop an algorithm to calculate similarity scores between different data points (e.g., biological structures, sequences). This matrix is dynamic and updates with new or modified data.

### Continuous Learning
- **Description**: Retrain the model periodically or when new data reaches a certain threshold. This ensures the model remains up-to-date and enhances its predictive capabilities.

### User Feedback Loop
- **Description**: Enable users to provide feedback or corrections to the model's findings, refining the accuracy of the similarity matrix and other model-generated data.

### Visualization Tools
- **Description**: Integrate visualization tools in the GUI to display the similarity matrix and new relationships, making complex data understandable for both experts and non-experts.

## 2. Interactive AI in GUI

### AI-Powered Chat Interface
- **Description**: Implement an AI chatbot in the GUI that interacts with users to understand their needs, like downloading files, analyzing data, or finding dataset information.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Description**: Use NLP techniques for the AI to comprehend and respond to user queries in natural language, enhancing user interaction intuitiveness.

### Guided Navigation
- **Description**: The AI guides users through the application, suggesting features and functionalities based on the user's inputs and needs.

### Task Automation
- **Description**: The AI performs tasks like fetching data, initiating downloads, or running specific analyses based on user responses, streamlining the user experience.

### User Behavior Learning
- **Description**: Over time, the AI learns from user interactions to provide more personalized and relevant suggestions or assistance.
